## Ingredients

* 8 large ripe pears , peeled, cut into 1 inch cubes (about 8 cups)
* 2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/4 cup water

## Instructions

Put the pears, maple syrup, cinnamon, ginger, and water into a medium pot, stir well, and set over high heat. When the liquid comes to a boil, drop the heat to low, cover the pot with a lid, and simmer.

Cook the pears, stirring occasionally, until they are tender enough to mash with a fork, about 20 minutes. Be sure that a little liquid remains in the bottom of the pot at all times. If not, add a tablespoon or 2 as needed. If quite a bit of juice remains when the pears are nearly cooked, remove the lid and turn up the heat so excess liquid evaporates.

Transfer the pears to a blender or food processor and puree until silky smooth. Serve warm or store in a container and refrigerate. The sauce will firm up as it cools.
