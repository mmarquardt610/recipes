## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups white flour (NOT wheat)
* 1 T sugar
* 1/2 t baking powder
* 1/2 t salt
* 2 cups milk
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 t vanilla
* 2 T butter, melted

## Directions

Measure flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into bowl. Stir in remaining ingredients. Whisk until smooth.

Heat 8-inch skillet over medium heat. Lightly butter the pan, heat until butter bubbles. Pour 1/4 cup of batter into skillet; immediately rotate pan until batter covers bottom. When edges start to cook and bubbles arrive, flip the crepe and brown on the other side.

Throw out that first crepe. That crepe is never good, no one knows why. Or give it to the dog. The next crepe will be perfect, no need to keep buttering the skillet.

## Preparation

Cover the crepe with toppings of choice (whipped cream / fresh berries, butter / cinnamon / sugar, chocolate / bananas), then roll the crepe like a cigar, or fold. This is the creative part of breakfast. Top with more goodies and enjoy!

## Yield 

12 crepes
