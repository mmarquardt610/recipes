## History

### Dinner at home - Dec 19 2018

Almost burnt down the house. I tried to make the eggplants roasted whole, matching the original recipe, but my kitchen started smoking up after 20 minutes, so I took it out and less the place air out and cool down. The original recipe said to bake the eggplants whole at 500 degrees for 40 minutes. Instead, I cut the eggplant and roasted pieces, which probably had no effect on the recipe.

I used 1 serrano pepper and it had some heat but wasn't overwhelming. 2 serrano peppers might be too spicy.

When I made this, I had a couple of potatoes left in my fridge, so I boiled though, cut them into pieces and folded them into the dish at the end.

BTW - cilantro was totally optional, doesn't really need it. Makes it look pretty though:

This recipe made plenty, you can definitely feed a couple of hungry folks and freeze the other half for a future meal.
