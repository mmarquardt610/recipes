## Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 6 cloves garlic , sliced into thin slivers
* 1 pound baby spinach leaves
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice or vinegar (optional)
* Some bacon

## Instructions

Cut up the bacon into small pieces. Fry up in a pan. Once cooked, remove from pan and set aside. Drain excess oil.

Add the olive oil and slivered garlic slices to the skillet. Cook until the garlic is fragrant and begins to caramelize, but watch it closely so it doesn't brown or it will become bitter. Quickly remove the garlic from the oil with a mesh skimmer and reserve the oil in the skillet. 

Add the spinach in heaping batches, tossing in the oil as it reduces. Season with the kosher salt and freshly ground pepper and cook just until it wilts.

Add the garlic back to the spinach, toss, and drizzle with the lemon juice or vinegar and taste for seasoning. Serve hot.
