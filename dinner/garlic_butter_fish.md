## Ingredients
* 12 oz. firm white fish fillet (halibut, cod or pollock fillet)
* salt
* ground black pepper
* 3 dashes cayenne pepper
* 2 tablespoons corn starch
* 2 tablespoons cooking oil
* lemon wedges
* 1/2 stick salted butter, melted (4 tablespoons)
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice
* 1 tablespoon chopped parsley

## Instructions

Cut the fish into pieces, not to thin for easy pan-frying. Season the fish with salt, black pepper and cayenne pepper. Coat the fish with corn starch. Set aside.

Prepare the Garlic Butter Sauce by mixing all the ingredients together. Set aside.

Heat up a skillet (preferably non-stick) on medium heat. Add the cooking oil and once the oil is heated, pan-fry the fish in a single layer until both sides turn crispy and golden brown. Use a wooden spatula or tong to gently flip the fish over. Try not to break the fish.

Remove the fish from the skillet and drain on paper towels. Toss the fish with the Garlic Butter Sauce and serve immediately with lemon wedges.
