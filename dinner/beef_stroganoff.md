# Ingredients

* 8 oz extra-wide egg noodles
* 2 TBSP olive oil or unsalted butter (divided in half)
* 2 cups diced yellow onion
* 12-16 oz fresh cremini mushrooms (also called baby portobello mushrooms)
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/4-1/2 tsp dried thyme
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp black pepper
* 1/2 cup sherry or dry white wine
* 1/2 TBSP soy sauce
* 2 TBSP all-purpose flour
* 1/4 cup vegetable broth
* 1/4 cup heavy cream
* 2 TBSP sour cream
* 2 TBSP chopped chives for topping
* additional salt and pepper to taste

## OPTIONAL EXTRAS
* 2-3 TBSP grated parmesan or mozzarella cheese for topping
* 2-3 TBSP crushed crackers or breadcrumbs for tasty texture on top
* 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes

# Instructions

Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook egg noodles according to package directions, approx. 8-10 minutes. While you wait, measure out all the ingredients above and start the veggies. This dish comes together crazy fast when you have everything ready to go!

In a large pot or high-sided pan, heat a tablespoon of olive oil or butter over medium-high heat. Once it's hot, add the onion and cook for 4 minutes, then add your mushrooms. Sauté for an additional 4-5 minutes, or until mushrooms are browned and tender.

Reduce heat to medium, then add the remaining oil/butter to the pan along with garlic and spices (thyme, salt, and pepper). Sauté garlic for about 30 seconds until fragrant.

Add sherry/wine and soy sauce. Whisk together and, once hot, whisk in your flour. The mixture will start to clump and thicken, then you'll add your veggie broth and heavy cream.

Stir it all up then fold in your pasta and sour cream.

Garnish with chives (my favorite!) and any extras your heart desires. Dig in while it's hot!
