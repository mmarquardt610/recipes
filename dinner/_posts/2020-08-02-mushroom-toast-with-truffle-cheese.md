## Ingredients

* 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter
* 11/4 lb. assorted mushrooms (such as shiitake, oyster, and maitake), tough stems removed and caps torn or sliced
* Salt and black pepper to taste
* 2 Tbsp. minced shallots
* 2 tsp. minced fresh garlic
* 1/4 cup dry sherry or brandy
* 1 cup quark cheese, softened
* 1/4 cup minced chives, divided
* 1 tsp. white truffle oil
* 4 slices artisan bread (such as sourdough or countrystyle Italian)
* 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, softened

## Directions

1. Preheat broiler to high with rack 6 inches from element.

2. Melt 2 Tbsp. butter in a sauté pan over medium heat. Add half the mushrooms and cook until brown and liquid nearly evaporates, about 10 minutes; season with salt and pepper, then transfer to a bowl.

3. Repeat cooking and seasoning with remaining 2 Tbsp. butter and mushrooms; transfer to same bowl.

4. Add shallots and garlic to pan; cook until shallots soften, 2 minutes.

5. Deglaze pan with sherry, scraping up any brown bits. Cook until sherry evaporates. Return mushrooms to pan; toss with shallot mixture until heated through.

6. Combine cheese, 2 Tbsp. chives, and truffle oil until smooth.

7. Brush both sides of bread slices with softened butter; arrange on a baking sheet. Broil bread slices until golden on both sides, 1–2 minutes per side.

8. Spread cheese mixture on bread slices; top with mushroom mixture and remaining 2 Tbsp. chives.
