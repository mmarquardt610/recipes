# Ingredients

* 1/2 lb lean ground beef
* 8 oz extra-wide egg noodles
* 2 TBSP olive oil or unsalted butter (divided in half)
* 1 cup diced yellow onion
* 12-16 oz fresh cremini mushrooms
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/4-1/2 tsp dried thyme
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp black pepper
* 1/2 cup sherry or dry white wine
* 1/2 TBSP soy sauce
* 2 TBSP all-purpose flour
* 1/4 cup vegetable broth
* 1/4 cup heavy cream
* 2 TBSP chopped chives for topping

## OPTIONAL EXTRAS
* 2-3 TBSP grated parmesan or mozzarella cheese for topping

# Instructions

Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook egg noodles according to package directions, approx. 8-10 minutes. While you wait, measure out all the ingredients above and start the veggies. This dish comes together crazy fast when you have everything ready to go!

In a pan, cook lean beef and drain oil. Set aside.

In a large pot or high-sided pan, heat a tablespoon of olive oil or butter over medium-high heat. Once it's hot, add the onion and cook for 4 minutes, then add your mushrooms. Sauté for an additional 4-5 minutes, or until mushrooms are browned and tender.

Reduce heat to medium, then add the remaining oil/butter to the pan along with garlic and spices (thyme, salt, and pepper). Sauté garlic for about 30 seconds until fragrant.

Add sherry/wine and soy sauce. Whisk together and, once hot, whisk in your flour. The mixture will start to clump and thicken, then you'll add your veggie broth and heavy cream. Add beef.

Stir it all up then fold in your pasta.

Garnish as desired. Dig in while it's hot!
