## INGREDIENTS
* 1/2 cup Cajun Spice Mix
* 12 oz dark beer
* 2 cups heavy cream
* 1 lb peeled shrimp, medium
* 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes

#### CAJUN SPICE MIX
* 1/2 cup sweet paprika
* 2 Tbs cayenne pepper
* 2 1/2 Tbs garlic powder
* 1 1/2 Tbs ground black pepper
* 1 1/2 Tbs ground white pepper
* 1 Tbs dried thyme
* 1 Tbs dried oregano
* 1 Tbs salt
* Combine all ingredients and mix well. Store in an airtight container.

## PREPARATION
In a heavy saucepan, mix cajun spice mix and beer. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a whisk to make a thick paste. Don't let it burn. Gradually stir in cream to make a smooth sauce. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally for 8 to 10 minutes or until sauce becomes thick and turns a rich rusty color. Add shrimp and red pepper flakes. Reduce heat and cook shrimp over low heat for 2-3 minutes or until shrimp are opaque. Serve with fresh baguette(s).
