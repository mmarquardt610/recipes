## Yields
Serves 4

## INGREDIENTS
* 1 pound brussels sprouts
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 teaspoon sea salt

## PREPARATION

1) Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Remove the leaves of the brussels sprouts. This is tedious work, but it can be done. You want as many leaves as possible, and you may need to keep cutting away the stem as you get deeper into the sprout.

2) Place the leaves on a baking sheet and drizzle generously with olive oil, tossing to coat. Sprinkle with the sea salt. Bake, turning every 5 to 7 minutes, until browned and crunchy, almost burnt, but not burnt.
