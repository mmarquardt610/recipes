## Ingredients

* 12 oz. Cajun-style andouille (such as Aidells), sliced
* 2 Tbsp. olive oil
* 1 bunch scallions, whites and greens separated and sliced
* 1 cup each diced celery 
* 1 cup red bell peppers
* 2 Tbsp. Cajun seasoning
* 1 Tbsp. minced fresh garlic
* 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth 
* 1 1/2 lb. russet potatoes, cubed 1/2 cup heavy cream
* Salt, black pepper, and Tabasco sauce to taste

## Directions

1. Brown andouille in oil in a pot over medium-high heat, 2 minutes per side; transfer to a plate and drain all but 1 Tbsp. drippings.

2. Add scallion whites, celery, bell peppers, Cajun seasoning, and garlic; reduce heat to medium, partially cover, and sweat until vegetables soften, 5 minutes.

3. Stir in broth and potatoes, partially cover, and bring soup to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer soup until potatoes are fork-tender, 15 minutes. Coarsely crush potatoes with a potato masher, then stir in cream, scallion greens, and andouille; season soup with salt, black pepper, and Tabasco.
