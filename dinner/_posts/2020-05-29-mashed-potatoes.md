## Ingredients

* 3 cloves garlic
* 4 pounds Russet Potatoes
* 1 Tablespoon Salt
* 1/2 cup Butter, Plus More For Serving
* 1 Tablespoon Sour Cream
* 1/2 cup Heavy Cream Or Milk
* Freshly Ground Pepper, to taste

## Directions

Roast the garlic, put in oven 450* for 30min. Continue onto potatoes while garlic roasts.

Peel the potatoes, rinse them and cut them into 1- to 2-inch pieces. Add to a large pot and add enough water to cover all of the potatoes. Heavily salt the water. I use about 1 tablespoon salt.

Place pot on your stove and turn heat to high. Bring to a boil and boil for 5–10 minutes, until potatoes easily break apart with a fork or a butter knife. Turn off heat.

Drain potatoes and return pot to the hot burner (that’s turned off). Leave the pot on the stove for at least 10 minutes, uncovered.

Add butter and roasted garlic and mix with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula so the butter is evenly distributed. Mash the potatoes to desired consistency. Add sour cream and mix together. Add heavy cream or milk and mix together. Add more if you like creamier potatoes. 

Add salt and pepper to taste. Add an extra pat of butter on top before serving. Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator and reheat to serve.
