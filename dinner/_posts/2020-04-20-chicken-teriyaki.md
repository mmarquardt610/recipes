## Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 2 tablespoons sake
* 2 tablespoons honey
* 1 slice (1/4-inch thick) fresh ginger
* 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed of fat
* Salt and pepper
* 1 tablespoon neutral-flavored oil like safflower, peanut or grapeseed
* Sliced scallions and black sesame seeds for garnish (optional)

## Instructions

1. Heat the soy sauce, mirin, sake, honey and ginger together in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer. Simmer 7-8 minutes until sauce is thickened. Remove the ginger. Set the sauce aside.

1. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. When the oil is hot, add the chicken, presentation side down. Sear the chicken without moving it, until browned, 4-5 minutes. Flip the chicken over and cover the pan. Cook another 7-8 minutes.

1. Uncover the pan, turn the heat up to high and pour the sauce over the chicken. As the sauce cooks, it will thicken even more and turn glossy. Turn the chicken often, coating it with the sauce. Continue cooking until most of the liquid has evaporated and the sauce forms a thick glaze on the chicken.

1. Let the chicken rest for a few minutes, then slice it and spoon any extra sauce on top. Garnish with scallions and sesame seeds, if desired. Serve with rice.
