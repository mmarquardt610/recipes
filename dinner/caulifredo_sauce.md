## History

### Jan 9, 2019 Dinner - Marquardt House

YUM. This is amazing, 5 stars for sure. Much more flavorful than creamy alfredo. We used roasted garlic instead of fresh garlic, definitely helped develop a robust flavor. And we tripled the amount of garlic. Could use more fat-ful milk, but we used nonfat and it was still plenty rich.

We threw the sauce over tortellini and chicken, paired it with homemade [French Bread](/bread/french_bread.md), artichokes, and gin martinis:
