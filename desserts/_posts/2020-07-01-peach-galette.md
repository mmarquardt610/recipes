## Ingredients

### Crust
* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, very cold, cut into small cubes
* 1/3 cup water, ice-cold, plus additional 1–2 Tbsp as needed

### Filling
* 1 1/2 lbs peaches, skin-on, pitted and cut into ½" slices
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1 Tbsp lime juice
* 2 Tbsp cornstarch
* 1 pinch salt
* 2 Tbsp unsalted butter, cut into small pieces

### Glaze
1 egg, well beaten (for egg wash)
1 Tbsp apricot preserves
1 tsp water

## Directions

To make the crust, combine flour, salt and cold butter cubes in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse several times until cubes become the size of peas. Transfer the flour mixture to a large mixing bowl and add ⅓ cup of ice-cold water. Stir gently, adding additional water if necessary, until dough forms a ball that is moist, but not sticky. Remove dough and wrap it with plastic wrap then shape into a round disk. Chill in the fridge at least 45 minutes.

Once dough has chilled, preheat oven to 425 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove dough from the fridge and place on a floured work surface. Roll the crust into a circle 14–16" in diameter, dusting with flour as needed to prevent sticking. Roll the dough around the rolling pin (to prevent dough from cracking) and lay it out flat on the baking sheet.

To make the filling, toss the sliced peaches, sugar, lime juice, cornstarch and salt in a large bowl until the cornstarch is completely dissolved. Spoon the filling into the center of the crust, leaving a 2" border all the way around. Fold the crust over the filling then brush some egg wash under any dough that overlaps—it’ll help the folds stick to one another. Dot the top of the filling with butter then brush the entire surface of the crust with the remaining egg wash.

Bake 20 minutes then rotate the pan and bake an additional 20–25 minutes. When the crust is golden brown and the center is piping hot and bubbly, remove the tart from the oven.

Stir the apricot jelly and hot water together to create a glaze then brush over the filling. Allow the tart to cool just long enough for the filling to set. Cut into wedges and serve warm.
