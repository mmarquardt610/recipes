Serves: 4-6


## Ingredients

* 4 large eggs
* 1 cup sugar
* ½ cup extra virgin olive oil
* 2½ tbsp lemon juice (roughly one lemon)
* 1 cup cake flour, sifted
* ½ tsp baking powder
* ¼ tsp salt
* 1 tsp lemon zest
* ¼ cup powdered icing sugar

## Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350*F and grease an 8 inch cake pan with butter or cooking spray.

Using a mixer, beat eggs and sugar on high until the mixture is fluffy and has doubled in volume; about 5-7 minutes.

While the eggs and sugar are mixing, in a separate bowl whisk together flour, baking powder, salt and lemon zest.

Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in olive oil and lemon juice into the egg mixture. Using the same spatula, fold in flour mixture into the wet mixture until the flour disappears. Take care o not overmix. You wan the cake to be light and fluffy.

Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan and gently tap on a solid surface to remove any bubbles.

Bake for 40-45 minutes until the top is a light brown and a toothpick entered in the center comes out clean.

Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes. Gently run a butter knife along the edges of the cake to release it from the pan and continue cooling on a wired rack. Dust with powdered icing sugar prior to serving.

You can also decorate the cake with the candied orange slices and cranberries if desired.
