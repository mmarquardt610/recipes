## Ingredients

* 1 cup butter, softened
* 1 cup white sugar
* 1 cup packed brown sugar
* 2 eggs
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 2 teaspoons hot water
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
* Salt to taste

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

In the bowl of a stand mixer or using a hand-held electric mixer, cream together the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Dissolve baking soda in hot water then add to batter along with salt. Mix in flour until incorporated. Fold in chocolate chips with a rubber spatula. Using a spring-loaded ice-cream scoop, drop even and large spoonfuls of dough onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet.

Cookies will bake for about 15 minutes total. Bake for ~13 minutes in the preheated oven, sprinkle salt in the center of each cookie, and cook 2 minutes more. Edges should be nicely browned when cookies are fully baked.

Let cool on a baking rack for a few minutes.

Pair with vanilla ice cream.
