source: http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/rose-sangria-mixed-berry-ice-ring

## Ingredients
* 1 cup blueberries
* 1 cup raspberries
* 1 cup sliced strawberries
* 1 cup blackberries
* Distilled water 
* Two (750-ml) bottles rosé 
* 1 cup light rum 
* 1 cup simple syrup (see Note)
* 1/2 cup Campari
* 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (about 2 lemons)

## How to Make It

Step 1

Layer the berries in a 10-inch Bundt pan. Gradually add just enough distilled water to cover. Freeze for at least 8 hours or overnight, until solid.

Step 2    

In a large punch bowl, stir the wine with the rum, simple syrup, Campari and lemon juice. Refrigerate until chilled, about 45 minutes.

Step 3    

Fill a large bowl with very hot water. Dip the bottom of the Bundt pan in the water to loosen the ice ring, and then invert it onto a plate. Add the ice ring to the sangria.

Step 4    

Serve with or without ice.

## Make Ahead
The ice ring can be frozen for up to 3 days. The sangria can be refrigerated overnight.

## Notes
To make 1 cup of simple syrup, combine 3/4 cup water and 3/4 cup sugar in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Let cool before using.
